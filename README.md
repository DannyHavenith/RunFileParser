LogParser, toolset for large car logger data sets
=======================================================

This toolset can be used to analyse, clean and manipulate RUN 
files generated by some automotive data loggers. 

The intent is to have the highest possible performance, that is:
data should be processed as fast as a disk can provide it (GB/s), while
at the same time making the software operate on the highest abstraction 
level.
